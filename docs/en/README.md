# Documentation index

English · [简体中文](../README.md)

Most documents are written in Chinese; seven have English translations, kept in the same layout under `docs/en/`.
When a translation and the Chinese version differ, the Chinese version is authoritative. Relative links and the
`docs/…md` paths in source comments are checked by `pnpm check:docs` (`scripts/check-doc-links.mjs`).
